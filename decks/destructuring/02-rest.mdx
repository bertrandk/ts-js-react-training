```notes
This is useful when are passing a number of properties into a function,
and want to 'pluck off' a few to be used - and pass the rest down
to another function.
```

export default Code;

```javascript Arrays - ...rest assignment
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let [first, second, ...rest] = numbers;
console.log(`Initial numbers unmodified:`, numbers);
console.log({first, second, rest});
```
