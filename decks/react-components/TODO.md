# React Components TODO

- Slide heavy - not many code examples or hands on moments
- Getting into Atomic Design can be useful - but not sure if it's the primary point of this section
- Key component concepts:

- they are a function that returns JSX
- or a class with a render method - that returns JSX
- they accept props
- Props are like the "API" of a component
- Maybe go over some props/rendering things - before doing the 'atomic design' stuff
- Lots of people are used to writing larger things first - can maybe start with that - then breaking things down
