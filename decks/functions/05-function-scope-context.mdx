# Scope and Context 

---

## Context vs Scope

- Similar, but not the same
- Every function execution has both 
- Scope is function based
- Context is object based

---

> Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. 

---

>  In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

---

## Variable Scope

- Local or Global 
- Local is within a function context
- `var` is hoisted to the top of the function 
- `let` and `const` are scoped within a block 

---

## Block Statements

- Statements like `if`, `switch`, `for` create a block

---

## Block Scope

- If using `let` or `const` - their scope is within that block
