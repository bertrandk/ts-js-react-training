something that is on my radar depending on how things are going with the typescale app, 

is Jen wants a simple app for people to nominate people for badges - got some details on it yesterday. 

The first MVP could simple - a react form that just posts to a google sheet or something (I want something a little more robust than a Google Form for the submission part).

But the short version is

* select a badge you want to nominate someone for, each badge has a few fields to fill out like

* Nominee Name:
* Department:
* Nominee Manger Name:

Please tell us in detail why you are nominating this team member for this badge and include specific details on how they demonstrated Innovation as outlined in the badge description:
Nominator Name:

* Department:


Looks like some fields are common across all, others are unique to the badge - for example the client referral badge also has

* Client Referred:
* Date Client Project Signed:

most badges just need to be verified, but there are two that after submitted - have a comity  

I could see the initial version having the badge/questions in a JSON file (can be hardcoded for now)

but something like ...

```
const badges = [{
    badgeCode: 'BLOOD_DONOR',
    badgeName: 'Blood Donor',
    description: 'This badge is awarded to any Rangle employee who donates blood as part of Rangle Blood Drive events throughout the year.  This is a one-time award and the Rangle employee must be employed with Rangle to receive this badge.',
    fields: [{
        type: 'TextField',
        label: 'Full Name',
    },/* .... */,
    {
        type: 'DateField',
        label: 'Blood Donation Date'
    }]
}]
```

so someone would select the badge, then fill out the fields, hit submit - and could post to like a google sheet, or a netlifly form or something.

Longer term (non-MVP)

* Be able to pull data from BambooHR for things like department, manager, list of employees, etc
* The 'Admin' UI - so it's not just a google sheet 
* Notifications, etc 
* UI to add / edit badges - upload images, change fields, etc - instead of having it be hardcoded JSON

I'm going to review what Jen gave me a bit more, and see if I can do a bit of a breakdown / backlog - but is this an intenral tool that you'd be interested in helping out with in a bit?
