# Games Fetch - Cascading Dropdown

- The Games dropdown, and Games list are driven by the selected list in the platforms
- The data-fetch-game exercise has also been refactored to use hooks
- When you select a game in the Game dropdown list - the game block will be turned red
- Components were broken out into their own files, and placed in the components folder
- Created custom hooks for fetching the game details, and the platforms
